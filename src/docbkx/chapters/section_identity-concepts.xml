                <para>A user is a digital representation of a person, system, or service that uses
                    &CLOUD; services. Users have credentials and can be assigned tokens. They can
                    present this information to the &CIS; or other &CLOUD; services to confirm
                    identity and verify permission to access the requested system resources. </para>
                <para>
                    Users can also be assigned to a tenant or region so that they inherit a set of 
                    access rights and privileges automatically, based on the tenant or region configuration.
                </para>
                
                <para>In the &CLOUD; Users are represented as accounts created for specific
                    individuals. When a user is created, the &CIS; assigns a user type and a default
                    role automatically, based on the &CIS; system configuration. The user type and
                    role determine the resources and capabilities available to the user.</para>

                <para>A role is a common security construct for assigning a specific set of access

                <para>Roles can be assigned to users, groups, or tenants automatically based on

                    with the user. The service configuration determines how user roles are
                    interpreted. For example, a role that grants access to certain resources or
                    capabilities within one service can grant access to completely different

                    their cloud deployment, based on roles defined by Rackspace. For example, an
                    administrator can use RBAC to manage access to Cloud Servers as well as the
                    permissions to complete operations such as adding and deleting servers after

                    customer, account, organization, or project.</para>
                <para>In the &CLOUD;, tenants allow service providers to organize computing and
                    storage resources without assigning them to user accounts directly. For example,
                    Virtual machines (Cloud Servers) and containers (Cloud Files) are assigned to

                <para>Typically, a service provider determines how tenants are defined and used. The

                    tenants. Service administrators can also assign users and groups to one or more
                    tenants. Because each tenant can have its own role configuration, user can have
                    different roles, or different rights and privileges for the same role on
                    different tenants. </para>

                <para>Endpoint templates provide Cloud Service providers with a method to manage API
                    service endpoints that apply to many or all tenants without having to add each
                    endpoint on each tenant manually.  For example, a Service developer can define a
                    global endpoint template that is automatically included in the Service catalog
                    for all tenants authorized to use that service. The endpoint template also
                    specifies the URLs for the internal, administrative, and public endpoints that
                    provide access to the service. </para>

                    information. Typically, the service catalog returned to a System administrator has additional
