        The basic function of the authentication service is to validate a client's credentials. If a client offers valid credentials,
        Auth returns a token and a service catalog. The client can use the service catalog to find endpoints for the services it can use.
        To any of those services, the client can show the token as evidence of having been authenticated.

    <para> You can see some OpenStack-oriented illustrations of this
        idea, showing the OpenStack Keystone identity service

        Some of the OpenStack functions illustrated may not be
        consistent with the privileges available to you as a Rackspace
        customer; you are very welcome to examine this and other
        OpenStack publications as general background material, but
        please rely on Rackspace sources for specific information
        about what you can do and how you can do it.</para>

        If the client's authentication attempt fails, the authentication service returns <returnvalue>401</returnvalue> unAuth.
