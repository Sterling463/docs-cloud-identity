        <glossdef>
            <para>Authentication is the process that evaluates a set of claims to confirm the
                identity of  the user, process, or client presenting the claims. Initially, the
                claims are presented as a set of <glossterm baseform="Credentials-d1e03">credentials</glossterm>. 
                After initial confirmation based on these credentials,the authentication service 
                issues a <glossterm baseform="Token-d1e13"
                    >token</glossterm>. When making subsequent requests, the user can provide the
                token as evidence that the user's identity has already been authenticated. </para>
            <para>In the context of &CLOUD;, you authenticate by issuing a POST tokens API request
                with valid credentials to the &PRODNAME; endpoint. In response to valid credentials,
                the service returns an authentication token and a service catalog with information
                about the &CLOUD; resources that you have permission to access. You can use the
                authentication token and the service endpoint to use any of the cloud services
                included in the service catalog.</para>

            <para>Credentials are data that belong to and identify a specific user. Because

        <glossdef>
            <para>Endpoint templates provide Cloud Service providers with a method to define
                endpoints that apply to many or all tenants without having to create each endpoint
                on each tenant manually. For example, you can define an endpoint template and set
                the global attribute to true so that endpoint is automatically included in the
                Service catalog for all tenants authorized to use that service. For more
                information, see <olink targetdoc="Identity-Admin-Developer-Guide"

            <para> An endpoint is an entry point to an API. The endpoint is defined as a set of base URLs. API operations are
                defined relative to these URLs. An API may offer several regional endpoints for a single API. Rackspace
                provides two authentication endpoints: one for US-based accounts and one for UK-based accounts. To use v2.0
                of the API for authentication, specify the API version as shown below: </para>
