  <title>Multifactor authentication</title>
  <para>The &CIS; multifactor authentication service adds additional login security to &CLOUD;
    accounts. With multifactor authentication enabled, authentication is a two-step process:<orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>A user submits an inital POST tokens request to the Identity Service endpoint,
          including either API key or password credentials.</para>
        <para>The response body returned by the Identity service includes an X-SessionId header and
          a request for additional credentials. The Identity service also sends an SMS text message
          with a passcode to the phone number associated with the account.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>To complete the authentication process, the user submits a second POST tokens request,
          including the sessionId header and passcode as credentials.</para>
        <para>If the credentials are valid, the Identity service returns an authentication response
          that includes the authentication token and a service catalog showing the available
          services and <glossterm baseform="endpoint">endpoints</glossterm> to access the API for each service.</para>
        <important><para>Multifactor authentication is only supported by Rackspace Cloud Identity Service version 2.0 or later. User accounts set up for multifactor authentication cannot authenticate through version 1.1. </para></important>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist></para>
    <para>Users interested in enabling multifactor authentication must update their &CLOUD; user
    accounts to add a phone number that can be used in the authentication process, verify the phone,
    and enable the user account for multifactor authentication. This work can be completed from the Cloud Control panel 
    or by using the &CIS; API.</para>
