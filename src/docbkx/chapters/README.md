# This README relates only to the CHAPTERS in documentation for Auth 2.0 (aka Cloud Identity) #

Everything here is a fragment of one or more documents. To see how these fragments are assembled into full documents, start at /src/docbkx/auth-**admin-devguide**.xml and -**client-devguide**.xml

----

* If a filename ends in **-admin** or **-client**, its content is included in only that book. For example:

    * identity-operations-**admin**.xml is part of the Admin DevGuide only.
    * identity-operations-**client**.xml is part of the Client DevGuide only.


* If a filename does not end with the name of a book, its content is included in all books. For example:

    * identity-glossary.xml is part of both the Admin DevGuide and the Client DevGuide.
