# This README relates only to the FIGURES in documentation for Auth 2.0 (aka Cloud Identity) #

Everything here is a figure or the source for a figure included in one or more documents. 

----

* **.odg** is created by OpenOffice.org Draw. This is an open-source, all-platforms tool. If you don't have it, download it for free from http://www.openoffice.org/.

* **.graffle** is created by OmniGraffle. This is a proprietary, Mac-only tool.  If you don't have it, buy it from http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnigraffle/.

* **.vsd** is created by Visio. This is a proprietary, Windows-only tool. If you don't have it, buy it from http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/visio/visio-2010-buy-page-FX101836377.aspx.

None of these source filetypes can be used directly in a document. Export them to a filetype that can be included in HTML and PDF output; .png and .svg are good candidates.

Notes on including figures in documents are at https://one.rackspace.com:8443/display/RED/Figures.

**CONCEPTS**

The source for early drawings, originally used in the Concepts section but now unused, is **auth.odg**. It contains 1 page per drawing; for each drawing, the exported filename matches the name of the source page. 
Most drawings are too large at the natural size exported from auth.odg; probably resize to 60%. Keeping it around in case it helps get something else started.

The drawing used in the Concepts section as of the 2012-07-11 release, replacing two drawings from auth.odg, is a revision of the one used at OpenStack; 
the original is in https://github.com/openstack/openstack-manuals/tree/master/doc/src/docbkx/common/figures. 
The original was created by "Razique" and named "SCH_5002_V00_NUAC-Keystone";
that name may be meaningful in some indexing scheme but it isn't meaningful here; I kept a copy but am not using it.
We are using the revision, which I renamed to **auth-keystone-identity-manager**, almost matching text the Keystone version showed as a title but did not use as filename; this filename may be valuable for search-engine optimization 
since the name of the image on the page now matches some of the key textual content on the page. 

----
**RATE LIMITING**

For 3 drawings related to Rate Limiting, there is one source file per drawing. They are:

* ratelimitingflow.graffle
* auth20ratekeygeneration.graffle
* auth11ratekeygeneration.graffle

----
**IMPERSONATION**

For the drawing related to Impersonation, which I named **auth-impersonation**,I cannot include the source here since it came from Google Docs. 
Get it from https://docs.google.com/a/rackspace.com/drawings/d/1fxomVwZRmWT6NYmhTFwj9VMfQ_NQHLVfpfb6474xnoc/edit. 
Or if you have a lot of free time, use Inkscape to modify the exported .svg, included here. Good luck with that.
