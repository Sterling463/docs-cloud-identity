# This README relates only to the FIGURES in documentation for Auth 2.0 (aka Cloud Identity) #

Everything here is a figure or the source for a figure included in one or more documents. 

- .odg is created by OpenOffice.org Draw. This is an open-source, all-platforms tool. If you don't have it, download it for free from http://www.openoffice.org/.

- .graffle is created by OmniGraffle. This is a proprietary, Mac-only tool.  If you don't have it, buy it from http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnigraffle/.

The source for most figures is *auth.odg*. It contains 1 page per drawing; for each drawing, the exported filename matches the name of the source page. Most drawings are too large at the natural size exported from auth.odg; probably resize to 60%.

For 3 drawings related to rate limiting, there is one source file per drawing. They are:
- ratelimitingflow.graffle
- auth20ratekeygeneration.graffle
- auth11ratekeygeneration.graffle
