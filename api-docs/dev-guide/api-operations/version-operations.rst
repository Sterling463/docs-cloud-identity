API Contract Version 
----------------------

The Rackspace Cloud can support multiple versions of the service API
contract. This architecture allows service providers to develop, test,
and deploy new API versions without disrupting service for customers
that are using an existing version. You can use the Version operations
to query the API service endpoint for information about the API version
support in your cloud environment.

**API operations**

- List versions 
- Show version details
