===================
**API Reference**
===================

Learn about the available Rackspace Cloud Identity API resources and methods and see 
request and response examples.

Some of the Identity API operations require only the core authentication service API v2.0 and some 
require extensions to the API. If an extension is required, it is available in The Rackspace 
implementation of the OpenStack Identity (keystone) service. You can learn how to create 
API requests and understand the responses for operations that require extensions by 
reviewing the sample requests and responses included in this API reference. For more 
information about the available extensions, see :ref:`API extensions <extensions-ovw>`.
