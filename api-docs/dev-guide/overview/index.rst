About the API 
----------------

The Rackspace Cloud Identity API service enables developers to manage 
authentication and authorization services for  Rackspace Cloud services 
through a simple Representational State Transfer (REST) web service interface.

The Rackspace Cloud Identity service v2.0 is an implementation of
OpenStack Keystone Service v2.0 that provides common, token-based
authentication and authorization services that allow seamless access to
Rackspace Cloud products and services.

-  Authentication generates a token in response to valid credentials
   submitted by a user, process, or client. Then, that token is used to
   confirm identity when requesting access to systems or resources
   defined in the Cloud Identity service service catalog.

-  Authorization determines the resources and actions available to a
   user, client, or process based on access control capabilities that
   can be defined and managed using the Rackspace Cloud Identity
   service.
