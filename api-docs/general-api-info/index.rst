General API Information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Rackspace Cloud Identity authentication service allows clients to obtain tokens 
that can be used to access cloud services like those provided by Rackspace and
OpenStack.

The authentication service API is implemented using a RESTful web
service interface. All requests to authenticate and operate against the
authentication service should be performed using SSL over HTTP (HTTPS)
on TCP port 443.
