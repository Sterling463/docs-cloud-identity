~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Rackspace Cloud Identity service API provides authentication, authorization, and administrative 
service for customers with Rackspace Cloud accounts. You are not charged for using the 
Rackspace Cloud Identity API. You only pay for the Rackspace Cloud services that you use 
after authenticating based on the `Rackspace Cloud pricing schedule`_.

The service level agreement (SLA) for Rackspace Cloud Services is included in the `Rackspace Cloud SLA`_.

The terms of service are part of the `Rackspace Cloud Terms of Service`_. Periodically 
review these terms because they can be updated any time.
