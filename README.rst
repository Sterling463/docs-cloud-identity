# This README relates only to documentation for Auth 2.0 (aka Cloud Identity) #

This repo contains source material for two kinds of documents, intended for two kinds of readers:

- public-facing (Client API) documents are published at http://docs.rackspace.com/api/.
- RAX-internal (Admin API) documents are published at http://docs-internal.rackspace.com/api/.

Within /src/docbkx/, each file is the source for one book. Elements included within books, such as figures, code samples, and sections used in multiple books, are in subdirectories such as /figures/, /samples/ and /chapters/.

To talk about these documents, contact their caretaker: rose.coste@rackspace.com
